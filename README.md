# find_the_cat

## The problem

I found this problem in a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZyx9gHhRXM) from the MindYourDecisions channel.

The problem consists of creating the best way to find a cat. There are five boxes, the initial position of the cat is chosen randomly. Every night, the cat moves randomly to an adjacent box, and every morning, the player can choose a box and check if the cat is inside it or not. The game ends when the player finds the cat.
